The goal of this small application is to showcase usage of several testing frameworks
and libraries (like [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/),
[AssertJ](https://assertj.github.io/doc/),
[Spring](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing.html),
[ApprovalTest](https://github.com/approvals/approvaltests.java)).
